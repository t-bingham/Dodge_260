1. Making Dodge

1.1   Open a Linux terminal window (CTRL + ALT + T).
1.2   Navigate to the repository, using "cd". This should be .../ence260-ucfk4/team205/final.
1.2.a Use "ls" to check that there is a file called "Makefile" in the directory.
1.3   Enter "make", this will compile and link all the files.
1.3.a To skip Step 2 below, enter "make program" to compile, link and load the game onto the UC Fun Kit all at once. 


2. Loading Dodge onto the UC Fun Kit

2.1   Ensure you have completed Step 1 above.
2.2   Open the terminal and navigate to the repository containing game.out, this will be in the same place as the Makefile.
2.3   Reset the UC Fun Kit by pressing the S2 button.
2.4   Enter "make program" into the terminal.
2.5   The screen will display an arrow pointing to the Navswitch and the Blue LED will be lit when Dodge has been loaded on correctly. 


3. Playing Dodge

3.1   After loading Dodge onto the UC Fun Kit (Step 2 above), hold the UCFK with the cable running toward your right hand. Position it so that the IR Sender and Reciever are pointing toward your opponent's. Use your left hand to operate the navswitch and use your right to push S1 (on the opposite side of the display from the navswitch). Push the navswitch (indicated by the arrow on the LED Display) to signal that you are ready to play.
3.2   If you have done this before your opponent has, an ellipsis is diplayed on-screen until they have readied up.
3.3   When both players are ready the game starts immediately.
3.4   To move your character (the dot in the center of the screen) you can either move 1 step or hop 2 steps. To move push the navswitch either up or down to move in that direction. To hop press down the S1 button (located above the LED Display, on the other side to the navswitch) and push the navswitch up or down. If your character is at the bottom of the display and the gap is at the top you can wrap around the edges, so if you are in the very bottom row you can push the navswitch down and you'll end up in the very top row. WARNING! You can only move once per wall, so make sure you pick the right move!
3.5   The more walls you dodge, the faster they will approach! Walls can come from both directions, so watch out!
3.6   The game will end when one player fails to dodge a wall, the winner will be indicated by a crown icon displayed briefly on their screen, while the loser will have an X displayed on theirs. 
3.7   Keen for a rematch? After the game has ended and the winner has taken their glory, challenge them again by pushing the navswitch to the left, as indicated by the Y (Yes) displayed on screen. If you concede defeat or are too scared to lose your throne then push the navswitch right, towards the N (No). If both players select Yes then the game will reset, and both players will need to ready up again. Refer to Step 3.2.
